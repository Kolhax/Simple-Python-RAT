# Simple-Python-RAT
THIS IS ONLY FOR EDUCATIONNAL PURPOSE

# Why?
This is attempt on creating malware with different funcionality. This is solely for educational purposes only, I do not encourage hacking or using code maliciously.

This is intended for cybersec students who want to study how to develop malware for pentesting. I'm no expert I'm still studying myself :p I'm not resposible for any damage caused by this code, run/use at your own risk.
